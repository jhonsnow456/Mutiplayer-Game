JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a language independent data-interchange format.

JSON is built on two structures:

1) A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.

2) An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.

These are universal data structures. Virtually all modern programming languages support them in one form or another. 

In JSON, they take on these forms:

An object is an unordered set of name/value pairs. An object begins with {left brace and ends with }right brace. Each name is followed by :colon and the name/value pairs are separated by comma.

Example:
{  
"PizzaName" : "Veggie Paradise",   
"Base" : "Thin crust",  
"Toppings" : ["Jalepenos", "Black Olives", "Grilled Mushrooms", "Onions", "Cherry tomatoes"],  
"Spicy" : "yes",  
"Veg" : "yes"  
}  


An array is an ordered collection of values. An array begins with [ left bracket and ends with ] right bracket. Values are separated by comma.

Example:

["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"]  

[  
    {"name":"Anil", "email":"anil@gmail.com"},  
    {"name":"Bijay", "email":"bijay@gmail.com"}  
]  


A value can be a string in double quotes, or a number, or true or false or null, or an object or an array. These structures can be nested.
